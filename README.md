# SenseCrane
Control toy crane using motion with Raspberry Pi and SenseHat 

I kept seeing the micro:bit demo where you control a crane using motion and thought this must be possible with the Raspberry Pi and the SenseHat.  In fact it looked like the kind of thing that could be done using Scratch.

That's what this is.
The PNG is the Scratch code.  Unfortunately, I formatted the SD I was using for development before I added the Scratch file to GitHub.

See the blog post for the full details on how to make the project.
